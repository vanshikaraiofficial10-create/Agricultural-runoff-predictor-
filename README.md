# Agricultural Runoff Risk Analysis

This academic project analyzes the impact of agricultural runoff on nearby water bodies using environmental data and basic machine learning concepts.

## Overview
Agricultural runoff containing fertilizers and pesticides can significantly affect water quality. This project studies environmental parameters to assess potential water contamination risk levels.

## Parameters Considered
- Fertilizer usage
- Pesticide levels
- Soil moisture
- Distance from water sources
- Nutrient concentration indicators

## Methodology
- Studied classification-based machine learning concepts
- Worked with structured datasets containing environmental parameters
- Analyzed model predictions to understand water risk categorization

## Technologies Used
- Python
- VS Code

## Learning Outcome
Gained exposure to data handling, machine learning workflows, and real-world environmental problem analysis.
